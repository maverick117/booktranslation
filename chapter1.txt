Chapter 1 The History of Computers

	Our future lies in our past. If we were to explore the development of an object, the best way would be to learn from its history.
	The term "Computer Software" has only been around for a few decades. During these years, computer software has evolved from hardware dependent instructions to code which is portable and platform independent, and in recent years we have seen the boom in web apps in many public fields and markets. To date, software has went through many iterations. The underlying factors in the rapid development of computer software are the experience gained in the decades of using computers and the knowledge and methods gained in centuries of developing computational skills as well as the evolution of humanity itself, just as Figure 1-1 has shown. This is how we've been able to achieve rapid progress in software development and evolution, which contributes to the formation of the culture of computers and computer software.
	If we were to dive deeper into the characteristics and progressions of software in its various ages, further understand the origins of software and software culture, we would need to discuss the history involved, for which we would have to trace back to the roots of the history of computation of to understand the bond between computers and humanity.
	You would probably see history as either boring and tedious or fascinating and educative. But no matter which one it is, let us start our journey down the line of history of computation and computers, and explore the reasons behind needs of humanity for computers.
	This chapter divides the ages of computers based on the most popular method used by scholars worldwide, and will attempt to demonstrate it clearly to the reader.

1.1 From Fingers to Computers
	Computers have played an important role in the continued development of human civilization.
	From the early ages of wisdom, computation has been a major issue for the society. Whether if it's recording events, growth of production, development of commerce or the advancements in science and technology, computational power is always a requirement for these events to take place. We have evolved from using fingers to count, to using a bargaining chip or an abacus, and have strived to improve on the speed, range and accuracy of our calculations.
	It is these efforts to improve our computational power that led us to the birth of computers.
1.1.1 Early Calculation Tools
	It is probable that no one will really know when humanity first encountered computational problems. Archaeological findings suggest that in the Paleolithic age humans have already used carvings on bones and stone to represent some sort of calculation. As civilization progressed, the calculations needed in the daily lives of people gradually increased in range and complexity. This need forced humans to find more efficient and accurate ways of conducting calculations. 
	And of course, counting fingers would be the first method of calculation.
	Since our fingers are relatively flexible and easy to use, the method of counting fingers is highly influential. Our binary system of counting numbers may have originated from using our ten fingers to count. Even today as we are developing more and more sophisticated computers, using fingers represent simple numbers have assisted people in exchanging numbers. In ancient China, there even existed a practice in which people used fingers to bargain. In those ages, people wore long and loose clothes with spacious sleeves. When bargaining, people would either pull up their overalls or extend their right hand out of their sleeves, and would bargain inside sleeves or overalls. During this process, holding the index finger would mean one, both the index finger and middle finger would represent two, if the ring finger is added then it would express the number three, and adding the pinky would mean five. For numbers above five, holding the thumb and the pinky would mean six, while holding the thumb, index finger and middle finder would mean seven, the thumb and index finger extended would convey eight, the index finger curved into a hook would mean nine. Using this method of bargaining, one side would be giving finger gestures while the other side would say whether or not to agree on this price. This approach allows the buyer and seller to communicate in a covert fashion to protect their interests. This method was suitable under those circumstances, and in addition became a cultural feature and has gradually been handed down to this date.
	Despite having apparent advantages, counting fingers is also deeply flawed, with a narrow range of calculation and is volatile, meaning the results of the calculation cannot be preserved for long. It gradually phased out due to its flaws and people then began to explore other methods of calculation.
	The intelligence of humans have enabled us to use other forms of calculation, such as rope counting and bargaining disks. They have made calculation for humans convenient, and in this collection of calculation tools, the abacus would probably be most familiar with us.
1. The Abacus
	The abacus is a traditional Chinese calculating tool, and the oldest one that still exists today. It was developed from counting rods and was once the most widely used calculation tool worldwide.
	There have been many claims about the origins of the abacus, one of which dates the birth of the abacus to 600 B.C. During the final years of Eastern Han Dynasty, the book Shu Shu Ji Yi by the mathematician Xu Yue recorded fourteen ways of calculation, where the thirteen way "Zhu Suan" means the method of calculation of using an abacus. Northern Zhou Dynasty mathematician Zhen Luan noted "the board is divided into three parts, each containing five beads, the upper bead has a different color than the lower four beads. The bead with the different color represents five while the other four represents one." Therefore it was suggested that the abacus existed in the Han Dynasty, taking a different form than those found in modern days. But its representation of five using the upper bead is identical to current abacus. Some historians believe the name of the abacus "Suan Pan" first appeared in the book Jing Xiu Xian Sheng Wen Ji (The Collections of Mr. Jing Xiu) written by scholar Liu Yin in the Yuan Dynasty. The name "Suan Pan" has also appeared in Yuan Qu Xuan (Selected Yuan Dynasty Songs), in the anonymous Pang Ju Shi Wu Fang Lai Sheng Zhai, in which the line went "Being idle, I put my age on the abacus". The Jiu Gui Chu Fa (Nine normalized division) of the abacus was also found in Cheng Chu Bian Tong Suan Bao written by Yang Hui in 1274 and Suan Xue Qi Meng by Zhu Shi Jie in 1299. The book Jiu Zhang Xiang Zhu Bi Lei Suan Fa Da Quan written by Wu Jing contains detailed description of the usage of the abacus. The painting Qing Ming Shang He Tu by Northern Song artist Zhang Ze Duan also contains a drawing of an abacus. Apparently the use of the abacus was wide spread during or before Northern Song Dynasty.
	In the tenth century, the abacus found in Northern Song Dynasty is not that much different from ones we use today. Figure 1-2 shows the various forms of abacus that could be found in the history of China. Elaborate or simple, they still play an important role in people's lives, while some have become antiques and still are an integral component of Chinese culture.
	With the popularity of the abacus, some common ways of its usage have been compiled into rhymes for easy understanding which have been passed down generation to generation. Other books such as Suan Fa Tong Zong have introduced ways of using the abacus to multiply, divide, even to evaluate the square root and cubic root of numbers. During the 1960s, when China was developing its own atomic bombs, the leader of the research team Deng Jia Xian used the abacus and hand-turned computers to calculate the equations for the bomb, which took them nearly a year to accomplish, but laid the foundations for their continued research. If we assume that the abacus is a computer, and the rhymes for using the abacus to compute are simple algorithms, then a group of people using the abacus to calculate would be the term "Distributed Computing". They used oral language to convey information and arrived at the result collaboratively, improving the efficiency of using the abacus when compared with using it independently.
	In fact, China wasn't the only one with computational tools such as abacuses. Civilizations around the globe have developed various tools to aid computation. Some was to use fine sand and draw computational components on the surface, called the sandbox type abacus. Some had lines drawn on the a board and used stones to compute, called the panel type abacus. Although they vary in form, their underlying principle are similar. These rudimentary calculation tools have once been widely used to simplify computation and helped human civilization progress further. Even now some of these tools are still used as a common way of calculation.
2. Slide Rule
	The Slide Rule was once a very popular computational tool apart from the abacus.
	The Slide Rule originated in Europe in the 16th century. During the Renaissance, the European countries made great progress in science and arts. After the Scottish mathematician John Napier introduced logarithms in his book The Construction of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms, people realized the importance logaritms in mathematical research. Through this opportunity, the Slide Rule was founded.
	The Slide Rule, most often the logarithmic slide rule, as shown in Figure 1-3, consists of three interlocked marked rulers and a sliding window, called a cursor. From its introduction in the 17th century, it has been the most widely used computational tool and dominated scientific and engineering computations for three centuries. Its contribution to the development of human society cannot be diminished.
	The slide rule was introduced between 1620 and 1630, after the publication of the concept of the logarithm. In 1620, The English mathematician Edmund Gunter marked logarithms on a ruler, so he and his colleagues could look up logarithms conveniently. Gunter put the numbers proportionally on a line, thus the numbers are more dense on the left and more sparce on the right. With this ruler, the multiplication of two numbers could be done by measuring the length of the logarithm of the first number by a compass then marking the amount of the two logarithms added. The number pointed to by the compass will be the logarithm of the product of the two numbers.
	Using the basis of this ruler, at approximately 1622, the Anglican priest William Oughtred put two wooden logarithm rulers together and created the first Slide Rule. A few years later he invented the circular slide rule.
	Oughtred's invention made it possible for people to drop the logarithm table or even not knowing what a logarithm was to conduct multiplication by simply moving the slide rule. The slide rule was easy to use and carry around, and relieved people from the numbers.
	As the use of the slide rule grew popular, people made several changes and improvements to it. In 1814, Peter Roget, while delivering his speech to the Royal Society, introduced the double logarithmic slide rule, allowing for solving the power or root of fractions easily. In 1850, the French artillery lieutenant Amédée Mannheim chose four most commonly used logarithm rulers and added a cursor, forming a newer logarithm slide rule. In just a few years, this variation of the slide rule gradually became common with engineers, surveyor-cartographers, chemists and astronomers.
	The manufacturers of the slide rules added more and more symbols and markings so that calculation could be even more convenient, and slide rules for specific subjects were introduced. For instance, the slide rules for chemists had molecular weights while the slide rules for shipbuilding engineers had water pressure formulas, and the slide rules for designers of the atomic bombs had the atomic decay constant enscribed.
	As time went by, the slide rule became paramount. It participated in the construction of the Empire State Building and the Hoover Dam, the design of the suspensions of the Golden Gate Bridge, the automobile hydraulic transmission, the transistor radios and the Boeing 707 airliner. Countless engineers used these simple tools to creat engineering marvels.
	But after the invention and improvement of the steam engine, our society progressed into the first industrial revolution, numerous inventions of machinery origin were introduced, and the slide rule was gradually replaced with other machinery, and was gradually phased out of daily use. During this period, it was trendy to try to use machine power to replace manual labor. It is also true with computational tools. People began to invent machines which could handle different functions.
1.1.2 The Mechanical Age
	Human society progressed into the mechanical age after the first industrial revolution. In this period of time people started to search for ways of letting machines replace manual labor in order to improve the quality of living. It was also in this period of time that many acute inventors sensed the possibility of using gears, plates, wheels, shafts, bolts and levers, and other mechanical parts to construct a machine capable of conducting mathematical operations, thus forming a mechanical calculator.
	During this period of time many outstanding tools were introduced, from the 


1.3 Computer External Equipment
00	Along with the booming of computer, in order to make more people use computers more conveniently in daily life, to faciliate computers and human interactions, to realize more functions, many external equipments adherence to computers come into being as well.
	The computer people used ordinarily, are equipped with basic configurations keyboard, mouse, computer monitors, mainframe and various USB flash drives as external storage to store huge volumes of data for us. Multimedia devices like speakers, sound card  
bring us rich and colorful enjoyment of multimedia. Network devices such as network card (network interface controller) and router bring us into the world of internet…… A great many computer external equipment make our life even better. However, these are unimaginable back to the time first computer being produced. It is inline with the trend of history, comply with the development of computer culture, dose these configurations develop together and become a inseparable part of computers, imperceptibly popularize in people’s life. 
	Following we categorize them and introduce their own process of development in order.
