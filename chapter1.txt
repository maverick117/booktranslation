Chapter 1 The History of Computers

	Our future lies in our past. If we were to explore the development of an object, the best way would be to learn from its history.
	The term "Computer Software" has only been around for a few decades. During these years, computer software has evolved from hardware dependent instructions to code which is portable and platform independent, and in recent years we have seen the boom in web apps in many public fields and markets. To date, software has went through many iterations. The underlying factors in the rapid development of computer software are the experience gained in the decades of using computers and the knowledge and methods gained in centuries of developing computational skills as well as the evolution of humanity itself, just as Figure 1-1 has shown. This is how we've been able to achieve rapid progress in software development and evolution, which contributes to the formation of the culture of computers and computer software.
	If we were to dive deeper into the characteristics and progressions of software in its various ages, further understand the origins of software and software culture, we would need to discuss the history involved, for which we would have to trace back to the roots of the history of computation of to understand the bond between computers and humanity.
	You would probably see history as either boring and tedious or fascinating and educative. But no matter which one it is, let us start our journey down the line of history of computation and computers, and explore the reasons behind needs of humanity for computers.
	This chapter divides the ages of computers based on the most popular method used by scholars worldwide, and will attempt to demonstrate it clearly to the reader.

1.1 From Fingers to Computers
	Computers have played an important role in the continued development of human civilization.
	From the early ages of wisdom, computation has been a major issue for the society. Whether if it's recording events, growth of production, development of commerce or the advancements in science and technology, computational power is always a requirement for these events to take place. We have evolved from using fingers to count, to using a bargaining chip or an abacus, and have strived to improve on the speed, range and accuracy of our calculations.
	It is these efforts to improve our computational power that led us to the birth of computers.
1.1.1 Early Calculation Tools
	It is probable that no one will really know when humanity first encountered computational problems. Archaeological findings suggest that in the Paleolithic age humans have already used carvings on bones and stone to represent some sort of calculation. As civilization progressed, the calculations needed in the daily lives of people gradually increased in range and complexity. This need forced humans to find more efficient and accurate ways of conducting calculations. 
	And of course, counting fingers would be the first method of calculation.
	Since our fingers are relatively flexible and easy to use, the method of counting fingers is highly influential to the development of succeeding methods. Our binary system of counting numbers may have originated from using our ten fingers to count. Even today as we are developing more and more sophisticated computers, using fingers represent simple numbers have assisted people in exchanging numbers. In ancient China, there even existed a practice in which people used fingers to bargain. In those ages, people wore long and loose clothes with spacious sleeves. When bargaining, people would either pull up their overalls or extend their right hand out of their sleeves, and would bargain inside sleeves or overalls. During this process, holding the index finger would mean one, both the index finger and middle finger would represent two, if the ring finger is added then it would express the number three, and adding the pinky would mean five. For numbers above five, holding the thumb and the pinky would mean six, while holding the thumb, index finger and middle finder would mean seven, the thumb and index finger extended would convey eight, the index finger curved into a hook would mean nine. Using this method of bargaining, one side would be giving finger gestures while the other side would say whether or not to agree on this price. This approach allows the buyer and seller to communicate in a covert fashion to protect their interests. This method was suitable under those circumstances, and in addition became a cultural feature and has gradually been handed down to this date.
	Despite having apparent advantages, counting fingers is also deeply flawed, with a narrow range of calculation and is volatile, meaning the results of the calculation cannot be preserved for long. It gradually phased out due to its flaws and people then began to explore other methods of calculation.
	The intelligence of humans have enabled us to use other forms of calculation, such as rope counting and bargaining disks. They have made calculation for humans convenient, and in this collection of calculation tools, the abacus would probably be most familiar with us.

1.3 Computer External Equipment
	Along with the booming of computer, in order to make more people use computers more conveniently in daily life, to faciliate computers and human interactions, to realize more functions, many external equipments adherence to computers come into being as well.
	The computer people used ordinarily, are equipped with basic configurations keyboard, mouse, computer monitors, mainframe and various USB flash drives as external storage to store huge volumes of data for us. Multimedia devices like speakers, sound card  
bring us rich and colorful enjoyment of multimedia. Network devices such as network card (network interface controller) and router bring us into the world of internet…… A great many computer external equipment make our life even better. However, these are unimaginable back to the time first computer being produced. It is inline with the trend of history, comply with the development of computer culture, dose these configurations develop together and become a inseparable part of computers, imperceptibly popularize in people’s life. 
	Following we categorize them and introduce their own process of development in order.
